# ABOUT ME 

[Link to another page](./publications.html).

I am a PhD Student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at the [University of Notre Dame](https://biology.nd.edu),
where I am advised by [Alex Perkins](https://perkinslab.weebly.com). My research interests lie broadly in the
transmission and control of vector-borne diseases, and I use mathematical modeling to answer these questions.
My doctoral work primarily focuses on <i> P. falciparum </i> and <i> P. vivax </i> malaria, though I am involved
in vaccine impact modeling for yellow fever through the [Vaccine Impact Modeling Consortium](https://vaccineimpact.org).
Prior to my PhD, I received my MPhil in Veterinary Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.research.vet.cam.ac.uk)
with support from a Gates Cambridge Scholarship, and I studied applied mathematics at the University of Notre Dame. Outside of research, I enjoy
running, cooking, and trying my hand at homebrewing.

* JAN 2020 - Our paper on the role that mathematical modeling can play in studying within-host
infection dynamics was just published in [Pathogens and Disease](https://watermark.silverchair.com/ftaa001.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAmIwggJeBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJPMIICSwIBADCCAkQGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMxhQ8KYyyVhHy129aAgEQgIICFVyQlzzqxfm2YFx7XMZxDVXhi64rCr6IUgRYWKAFmODM_Pi1bzDnP2fv37vnUbSfRTDUokQATryAMBM19vxPlibQr2Oe9me1fqJJG-kUq0rYB1ibe4-hAIiQ-wo-_tiKq8Ko8m7pWJcCo0cVlaLcWemDjIYMWknCyt5oS1TLrxFhwmu5KXTFDYZ3kZV40YhbDneciFzw9GF7J1gfvakh-usvewl3VJ7CrAph1yGYNxJrPMn47JCYvqNwK-rSNkuwCErgqf-pl1wXvpoThySFkLOy45psn6sur0I8T1w3E0Ublb1MdIIxdKgJd9P4qna9qtmOxLgfIzXenhYz_kMv7rFuB4dXVz6PwXNwn6yb-JL3njsjktaU_xLR3AHirKG8X1yqQ-KxqFBSEAX5-MKeKXU9pZbSdgx4ZfkB6KF4qhpO9nqjZYR8KR-3hOq91KXUQRBhqWGqRgBvhCbprKiW4fpM7UnY_Zd8F_jTosdrlucgTi3ftOgcDmFJfFbrk5eQ9WFXhAaGbjSN4yE1jV4mYK8dbIAt5p8TseBXJ06KMdV9KeEt-5rlE5A1tAGv2kYabCOQYvUF9-cgWv8LF-mVORG4S5PC_Yj4Vsdpz-V_6XMENbHv11wD3QdQtgDgoxd8Bnd7achASBzONh5X1JaUpifAdrbxWQj7u_LWgCD61ZuunMF8Wxx4WEy8WGy7Pr0buwUIibrf)!
